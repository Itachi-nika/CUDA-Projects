## INTRODUCTION ##
The NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano is a small, powerful computer that enables the development
of millions of new small, low-power AI systems. It´s suitable for edge AI applications and
research purposes.

In this project we will start to explore the GPU of the Jetson Orin Nano.
Using CUDA we can exploit the parallel power of the many cores found in the NVIDIA GPU.

## Learning Outcomes ##
- Understanding the basics of CUDA.
- Setup and run a simple CUDA program.
- Understand the importance of multi-threaded programs in high performance computing.
- See how parallel code can speed up calculations.
- Use profile tools to measure performance.
